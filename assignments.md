### Frequently asked questions about assignments

**What is the expected assignment workload?**

There are 6-7 assignments over the quarter, one per week. Assignments involve writing approximately 100 lines of code, and should be doable in 10 hours. The last assignment will be a project, and you will have two weeks to do the project. Projects are more open-ended and most students will spend more than 20 hours on their final project.

Starting early and making steady progress has been a generally more successful tactic than cramming the work into a last minute all-nighter.

**What programming environment and tools are used?**

Students will use their own laptop for the assignments. If you use a Mac laptop, you will be using the Terminal program and unix commaand line tools. If you own a Windows laptop, you will install a virtual machine running ubuntu linue and you will use the virtual machine for your assignments.

When developing on the Raspberry Pi, you will compile programs on your laptop and download them to the Raspberry Pi. We use a suite of open-source cross-development tools for arm processors. These include the `binutil` packages of tools, as well as `gcc` and `gdb`. Other tools such as `make` and `git` will also be used for development. You will also be expected to use a unix text editor such as `emacs` or `vi`, and become proficient using the unix shell.

Assignments are distributed to students as `git` repositories. Students edit, compile, and debug their assignments on their laptop. When they are finished, they hand in a final version by checking their files into their personal git repository.

**What is the policy on late assignments?**

Students are given a few self-granted grace days, a penalty is applied for further late work, and there a hard deadline after which no further late work will be accepted. Read our detailed late policy for the nitty-gritty mechanics.

**What is the assignment collaboration policy?**

The programming assignments are to be done individually and should represent independent, original work. We adhere to the CS department Honor Code policy and offer specific examples of its application to CS107E coursework in our course collaboration policy. All students are responsible for carefully reviewing both of these documents and acting in accordance with them. We run all assignment submissions through a very thorough plagiarism detector and all suspected violations are handled by Stanford's Office of Community Standards.

**How do I submit an assignment?**

Assignments are submitted online using `git` tool on the myth systems. Consult the `git` guide for information about how to use `git`.

**How are assignments graded?**

Each assignment will have a clear specification of what the program should do. If there are multiple features, it will be clear how much of your grade depends on each feature.

We will also look at your code and assess the code quality. Points will be docked for poorly written code.

**How do assignments figure into the course grade?**

The assignments contribute 80% of course grade. 

**How do extensions work?**


**What is the final project?**
