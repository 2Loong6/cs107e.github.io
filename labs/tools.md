## Tool Suggestions

*By Pat Hanrahan*

We will using the following tools in the lab.

We do not have enough tools for everyone,
so you will have to share them.
If you own tools, bring them to lab.
We like people to use their own tools; 
it is very empowering.
And that also means you will be able to work outside of lab.
If you don't own these tools, don't worry. 
If you want to buy tools and don't know what to buy,
talk to the instructors. They love tools!

During this first lab you will be using
a wire strippers/cutter (yellow handled widget), 
a needle-nose pliers (green-handled widget), 
and a multimeter (the orange thing with a display).
Don't worry about wire and other supplies;
we'll provide that.

If you don't have tools, and you want to buy some,
here are my recommendations. 
These are high quality tools,
and the hand tools will last you a lifetime.
I've added some screw drivers,
since - although we may not use them in class - 
they are well worth having.
The multimeter is a good basic multimeter.
