1 Explain what must be true for a division expression in C to compile 
and execute correctly despite the lack of a ARM divide instruction. What
is the result of attempting to compile a true division that cannot be
so transformed? 

2 There are 7-segments on a 7-segment display labeled
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
Suppose you wire up these signals to your GPIO pins.
What values should you use for
A, B, C, D, E, F, G
if you want to display the digit 0?
The digit 1?

3 Using the sample Makefile, trace what happens when you issue "make" 
with no arguments: what does it try to build? how does it determine
what actions to take?
