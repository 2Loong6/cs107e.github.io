## Goals

During this lab you will:

- Confirm working install of developer tools
- Practice with command line, git, editor
- Binary and hexadecimal number representations

## How does lab work?

When you arrive at lab, say hello and introduce yourself to your
labmates.  Together you will tackle the exercises below.  Everyone is
encouraged to collaborate with other labmates to share insights and
offer each other useful tips. You pair up and use private messages to
exchange notes, or just talk to one another. The instructor and TA
will circulate to offer advice and answers so as to keep everyone
progressing smoothly.

Lab is a time to experiment and explore. After we introduce topics in
readings/lectures, you'll do guided exercises in lab to further your
understanding of the material, get hand-on practice with the tools in
a supported environment, and ready yourself to succeed at this week's
assignment.

Bare metal programming requires precision. A trivial typo or slight
misunderstanding can stop your progress cold. Working with the support
of your classmates and staff can make the difference between quickly
resolving that sticking point versus hours of frustration wrestling on
your own in the dark.

Each lab has a set of check-in questions that we want you to answer as
you go. Touch base with the staff on your answers to confirm your
understanding and resolve any confusion. The check-in questions are
intentionally simple and your responses are not graded; we use them as
a gauge of how you're doing with the material so that we know better
how to help guide you.

To get the most out of lab, don't set your goal at merely finishing
the absolute minimum required in the shortest possible time.  If you
already have a good handle on the material, use the lab period to dive
into further nooks and crannies or help out those peers who could
benefit from your experience.  You should also get to know the
instructors.  They are masters of the craft, and you will learn a lot
by talking to them and asking them questions.  Any topic is fair game.

The combination of hands-on experimentation, give and take with your
peers, and the expert guidance of our staff is what makes lab time
truly special.  Your sincere participation can really accelerate your
learning!

## Prelab preparation

To prepare, please do the following before coming to lab:

1. Follow the instructions in [installation guide](/guides/install) to set up your environment.
1. Review our guide to the [Unix command line](/guides/unix/).

## Lab exercises

When you start lab, pull up the [check-in questions](checkin) in your browser so you can refer to them as you go.

### 0. Clone the lab repo
Before starting lab, do a `git pull` in your copy of the `cs107e.github.io` repository to ensure your courseware files are up to date.

```
$ cd ~/cs107e_home/cs107e.github.io
$ git pull
```

The lab materials are distributed in a separate git
repository. We recommend that you store your copy of the lab under your `cs107e_home`.  Change to that directory now and clone lab0:

    $ cd ~/cs107e_home
    $ git clone https://github.com/cs107e/lab0

<a name="step1"></a>

### 1. Confirm installation
Use the __Final check steps__ at the end of the [installation guide](/guides/install) to confirm that the needed tools are installed and your environment is correctly configured. If you hit any snags, we can help you resolve in lab.

### 2. Inventory your kit
You should have received your CS107e parts kit. Unpack and identify each part and compare to the [kit inventory](/guides/bom/) to ensure your kit is complete.

### 3. Command-line scavenger hunt

### 4. Binary numbers

### 5. Editors

### 6. git


## Check in with TA

Each pair of students should periodically touch base with the TA as you answer the [check-in questions](checkin). The TA will
verify your understanding and can help with any unresolved issues.

Remember that the goal of the lab is not to answer exactly and only these questions -- it's to work through the material. The questions are an opportunity to self-test your understanding and confirm with us.

It's okay if you don't completely finish all of the exercises during
lab; your sincere participation for the full lab period is sufficient
for credit.  However, if you don't finish, we highly encourage you to
work those parts to solidify your knowledge of this material before
moving on.
