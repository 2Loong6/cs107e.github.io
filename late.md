## Late policy

*Written by Pat Hanrahan*

Hofstadter's Law: "It always takes longer than you think,
even when you take Hofstadter's Law into account."

The rules:

1. The cutoff for on-time submission is **midnight** of the due date.
Late days are counted in 24-hour periods.
Submitting one minute past midnight until midnight of the next day 
is one day late, and so on.  

2. You are given **4 "grace days"** (self-granted extensions)
which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty.

3. Instructor-granted extensions are only considered 
**after all grace days are used** and only given in exceptional situations.  

4. Late work handed in when you have run out of grace is 
**discounted 10% per day late**.  
It is always to your advantage to complete all the assignments
even if they are late.

5. Late submissions (penalty or not) are not accepted after the hard deadline,
which is **4 days past the original due date,** 
but may be restricted to fewer days on a per-assignment basis.

6. The final project must be submitted on time.
