## Late policy

Written by Julie Zelenski, tweaked by Pat Hanrahan

Hofstadter's Law: "It always takes longer than you think, even when you take Hofstadter's Law into account."

### Late policy: just the facts

1. The cutoff for on-time submission is **midnight** of the due date. Late days are counted in 24-hour periods. Submitting one minute past midnight until midnight of the next day is one day late, and so on.  

2. You are given **4 "grace days"** (self-granted extensions) which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty.

3. Instructor-granted extensions are only considered **after all grace days are used** and only given in exceptional situations.

4. Late work handed in when you have run out of grace is **discounted 10% per day late**.  

5. Late submissions (penalty or not) are not accepted after the hard deadline. The hard deadline is typically **4 days past** the original due date, but may be restricted to fewer on a per-assignment basis.

### Late policy: long-winded version

The philosophy driving our late policy has three goals:

* **Discourage lateness.** Time management is a valuable skill and we want to provide incentives for you to balance your commitments and adapt/triage as necessary to meet deadlines. We curtaillateness by providing only a limited amount of grace, applying a penalty for lateness beyond grace, and enforcing a hard deadline.  

* **Empower you to make your own decisions.** You are The Decider for when your situation warrants the use of a grace day.  

* **Keep things fair.** Students are allowed an equal amount of grace. Only a truly exceptional situation is granted extension beyond the grace days.

**Self-granted extensions (AKA "grace days")**

Grace days are "self-granted extensions". We recognize that the
competing demands of a challenging courseload and extracurriculars
can be an unforgiving landscape and even the most careful of plans
can be derailed by an unforeseen event. When the unexpected happens
-- you get the flu, you delete a critical file, a personal situation
escalates -- you usually have to request an extension from the
instructor. Instead you are given the resources to grant yourself
an extension without my oversight. One grace day extends the deadline
by 24 hours. Grace days allow you to adjust for setbacks beyond
your control: illness, stolen laptops, bike accidents, network
downtime, travel delays, and so on. Although we don't intend them
to cover ski trips, overcommitment, or poor planning, you can use
them as you choose and we don't check up on you. You may use all
of your grace days for one assignment, distribute them across several
assignments, or even better, hoard them for a crisis that thankfully
never comes.

**Instructor-granted extensions**

Instructor-granted extensions are considered only when a student
has exhausted all grace days for valid reasons and requires further
accommodation. In such extenuating circumstances, please contact
the instructor (not the TAs), preferably in person, to discuss
possible arrangements.

Students often go to great lengths to meet deadlines and conserve
grace days: pull all-nighters, ignore other classes, miss events
they wanted to attend, work when feeling poorly, submit unpolished
programs, or take penalty late days as a last resort. It would not
be respectful of their efforts to hand out extra days to students
who were less committed to meeting deadlines or not as cautious in
conserving grace days. If asking for an instructor-granted extension,
you will be expected to legitimize how all of your grace days were
used and make a compelling case that your situation warrants even
further accommodation. We use this information to find an appropriate
balance between providing relief to you and maintaining fairness
to others.

**Late work with penalty**

When you are out of grace days, you may submit late work (up to the
hard deadline), but it will be penalized approximately 10% per day.
By this calculation, it is worth taking a penalty late day if you
have significant work you can complete, but if you have only small
details to polish, it is better to turn it in and move on. The
penalty is smoothed to an approximation of 10% that is uniform for
all assignments, regardless of total points for the specific
assignment that is late. This gives you the freedom to use late
days as you need them rather than trying to schedule them for when
they are worth the most.  

### Frequently asked questions about the late policy 

**Do I need to make special arrangements for a late submission?**

No, just submit normally. The timestamp on your submission determines
the assignment's lateness. Our system tracks the total number of
late days used across the quarter and if the count used exceeds the
available grace days, a late penalty will apply. Note that no
assignments (penalty or not) will be accepted after the hard deadline.

**How can I tell how many late days I have used?**

The online gradebook records the number of late days used on each
assignment.  

**I deserve an extension for [valid-justification] and
I don't want to use my grace days to cover it. How do I arrange an
extension?**

Grace days are extensions, no different than what would be given
by the instructor (other than you have the authority to determine
when one is warranted). Your first line of recourse when crisis
strikes is to grant your own extension through use of a grace day.
A request for an instructor-granted extension instead of using your
own grace days will never be approved.  

**I already used all my grace days for [valid-or-not-so-valid-justification], but now I have
[unimpeachably-legitimate-crisis]. How do I arrange the extension which I so clearly deserve? :-)**

We want to help you respond to your current tough situation, but
being mindful of fairness and consistency, we are going to first
ask you to justify your grace day usage before giving any additional.
As a thought experiment, consider how it would play if your lateness
were reordered (e.g. having used your grace days for ordinary
scheduling relief and now needing more for a sprained wrist should
be treated the same as having spent your days on an injury and
requesting more when a busy week comes up). In a course where
extensions were only granted by instructor decree, would each of
the situation(s) that prompted use of your grace days have warranted
asking for and receiving instructor-granted approval? If your quarter
has been one of extenuating circumstances where extension-worthy
causes consume all your grace days and then some, it will be
appropriate to arrange a different deal with you than what your
classmates receive. Come see us (Pat), preferably in person. I'll
want to hear how your grace days were spent and your proposal for
what extra accommodation is fair; we'll work from there to settle
an appropriate arrangement.  

**I'm accumulating a distressing number of penalty late days. Am I doomed?**

Given the relentless pace of the quarter system, finishing one
assignment late almost always means starting the next one late. It
can be hard to break out of this cycle, and what is initially one
or two days of late penalty becomes multiplied by the number of
assignments that follow. Making a heroic effort now to submit the
current assignment on time may have a substantial payoff in getting
you back on track. If it's going to take a deliberate sacrifice,
ask for our help in identifying what corners you might cut to submit
an incomplete/unpolished program that can still earn a decent score.
In the final course grade analysis, I try to ameliorate the sting
of stacked-up late days by applying a slight decay on the cost of
every subsequent penalty late day and not exercising the
must-pass-assignments-to-pass-class rule in cases where it is only
the application of late penalties that pushes the assignments below
the passing mark.
