# cs107e - Computer Systems from the Ground Up

## Announcements

Welcome to the Winter 2015 offering of CS107e.

The first class is Mon Jan 5 12:50 pm in Rm 107 Littlefield Center.

## Course Information 

**Course Description:** 

CS107 is the third course in Stanford's introductory programming sequence.
Our CS106 courses provide students with a solid foundation in programming methodology and abstractions and CS107 follows on to build up their programming maturity and expand breadth and depth of experience. The course will work from the C programming language down to the microprocessor to de-mystify the machine. With a complete understanding of how computer systems execute programs and manipulate data, you will become a more effective programmer, especially in dealing with issues of debugging, performance, portability, and robustness.

CS107e is an experimental approach 
that teaches the fundamental concepts of computer systems 
through bare metal programming on the Raspberry Pi.
Bare metal programming means you will not be run an operating
system on the Raspberry Pi, and will make minimal use of libraries.

Topics covered include: the C programming language, data representation, machine-level code, computer arithmetic, compilation, memory organization and management, debugging, hardware, and I/O.

**Prerequisite:** 106B or X, and consent of instructor. 

**Lectures:** Mon & Fri 12:50-2:05 pm, Rm 107, Littlefield Center

**Lab:** Tue: 7:00-9:00 pm, Gates 415

**Lecturers:** Dawson Engler, Pat Hanrahan, Phil Levis

**CA:** Isabel Bush

## Schedule

In the readings, K&R is The C Programming Language (Kernighan and Ritchie),
and EssentialC is a PDF available at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101. 
A digital copy of K&R is available to Stanford students via Safari Books Online.
Read before attending lecture and lab for best effect.

Slides and code from lecture will be available in Lectures.

You should also read the course [Guides](guide/README.md) for each week.
