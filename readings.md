### Raspberry Pi Hardware

We are using the raspberry pi A+ in class. The A+ is similar to the B+.

* [Raspberry Pi Board Schematics](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/hardware/raspberrypi/schematics/README.md)

* [Broadcom BCM2835 Peripherals Documentation](http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf)

  * [Errata](http://elinux.org/BCM2835_datasheet_errata)

  * [GPIO Pad Control](http://www.scribd.com/doc/101830961/GPIO-Pads-Control2).

### ARM

* The ARM1176JFZ-S (used by the Raspberry Pi) is documented
in the [Technical Reference Manual](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0301h/DDI0301H_arm1176jzfs_r0p7_trm.pdf).  
The following short [excerpt](lectures/ASM/armisa.pdf)
describes just the instructions.

* ARM1176JFZ-S processors use the ARMv6 architecture,
[ARMv6 Architecture Manual](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~waldroj/3d1/arm_arm.pdf).

* ARM System Developer's Guide: Designing and Optimizing System Software (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design), Andrew Sloss, Dominic Symes, and Chris Wright, 2004. This book is a bit dated, but still provides an excellent overview of low-level ARM programming.
Google and you might be able to find a free pdf.

* Excellent [slides](http://twins.ee.nctu.edu.tw/courses/ip_core_02/handout_pdf/Chapter_2.pdf) by Prof. Yen at NCTU on the ARM processor core and instruction sets.

### ARM Assembly Language

* Carl Burch's [Introduction to ARM Assembly Language](http://www.toves.org/books/arm/) is highly recommended starting point.

* [Worldwind Tour of ARM Assembly](http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/asm.htm) from the TONC Guide to programming the Nintendo Game Boy Advance (which uses am ARM processor).

* [Davespace Introduction to ARM Course](http://www.davespace.co.uk/arm/introduction-to-arm/index.html).

* [Thinkingeek ARM Assembler for the Raspberry Pi](http://thinkingeek.com/2013/01/09/arm-assembler-raspberry-pi-chapter-1/).

### Bare Metal Programming

* David Welch's excellent set of [bare metal programming examples](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi).

* Steve Halliday's [videos](http://computersciencevideos.org/Raspberry-Pi/Raspberry-Pi-Setup) about programming the raspberry pi.

* Alex Chadwick's [Baking Pi Course](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/).

* The [Raspberry Pi Bare Metal Forum](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=72) has lots of information from experienced developers. Venturing into the forum is a great way to learn advanced techniques.
