<h2>Assignment 6: From Keyboard to Screen</h2>
<p><img alt="Matrix Trinity Hack" src="images/shell.png" /></p>
<p>In this assignment, you'll get a PS2 keyboard working with your
Raspberry Pi. This will let you type in commands and control the
Pi without needing to plug another computer into it.</p>
<h3>Learning goals</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you will</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how PS2 scan codes work </li>
<li>Write a small driver that correctly translates PS2 scan codes into
    ASCII characters that can be displayed on the screen</li>
<li>Write a console program that allows you to type in and execute
    commands.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Assignment tasks</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull the assignment 6 project.</strong></p>
<p>To start the assignment, find the <code>courseware/assign/assign6/code</code>
directory. You may need to pull from the <code>cs107e/courseware</code> repository
to get the latest code. </p>
<p>This project includes one file that will help you significantly,
<code>ps2.h</code>. This file defines a few useful constants and two arrays,
<code>lookup_table</code> and <code>shift_lookup_table</code>, which are 128-element <code>char</code>
arrays that map key codes on the range 0x00-0x7f to ASCII characters.
The first is for when shift is not enagaged (e.g., "a" or "5"), while the
second is for when shift is engaged (e.g., "A" or "%").</p>
<p>The project also has <code>keyboard.h</code> and <code>console.h</code>, which you will
implement in this assignment. You will need to make your own
<code>keyboard.c</code> and <code>console.c</code> files and include them in the
Makefile as you make progress in the assignment.</p>
<p>Finally, there is <code>fractal.h</code> and <code>fractal.c</code>, which you'll use
for commands you can type at the command line.</p>
<p>You will probably want to copy your lab6 code into the code directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Process PS2 scan codes.</strong> Recall from lecture that a PS2 scan code
    is an 8-odd-1 packet consisting of 11 bits. The first bit, the start
    bit, is low. The next 8 bits are data bits, least significant bit first.
    The tenth bit is a parity bit -- odd parity means that there should be
    an odd number of 1s in the data and parity bits. The 11th and final
    bit is the stop bit, which is always high.</p>
<p><img alt="PS2 Packet Format" src="images/ps2.png" /></p>
<p>Implement <code>keyboard_init()</code> and <code>keyboard_read()</code> in <code>keyboard.h</code>.
You should build on your lab code to do so: initalize GPIO pins 23
and 24 to be inputs with pull-up resistors. Recall that PS2 sends
a new data bit on the data line on a falling clock edge, so when
reading pin 23 goes from high to low.</p>
<p>At this point, whenever you read a scan code, translate it to an
ASCII character and display it on the screen. Do not worry about
shift or other complexities. You can display the typed character
as a character in a fixed position on the screen using a single-buffered
graphics library. This way, a letter will appear immediately when
you type it. All you need is a while loop that reads a character
and draws it.</p>
<p><img alt="PS2 Scan Codes" src="images/scancode.gif" /></p>
<p>Note that since you are simply turning scan codes to characters, typing
some keys might lead to strange symbols appearing on the screen.
That's fine: what matters is that typing basic characters shows up
correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handle key press vs. key release.</strong></p>
<p>When you press a key, the PS2 keyboard sends a scan code. When you
release the same key, it also sends a scan code. This scan code
is the same as the first one, except it is one byte longer: it
has a leading <code>0xF0</code>. So typing z will cause the keyboard to
send scan code <code>0x1A</code>. Releasing z will cause the keyboard to
send scan code <code>0xF0 0x1A</code>. If you hold down z long enough
the keyboard will send multiple press scan codes (auto-repeat).</p>
<p>Modify your keyboard driver so it will only return characters
that are pressed, not those that are released. I.e., if the
scan codes received are <code>0x1A</code>, <code>0x1A</code>, <code>0xF0 0x1A</code> and <code>0x34</code>,
the calls to <code>keyboard_read()</code> would have returned z, z, g,
and not z, z, z, g.</p>
<p>Also, modify your driver so it ignores (reads and does nothing with)
a value of <code>0xE0</code>. This code is used for some more advanced keys.
Ignoring it means that you might see some funny behavior (e.g., pressing
volume up will cause a b to be read), but that's OK. If you don't
do this then pressing keys which have an <code>0xE0</code>, such as the right
control key, will cause multiple characters to be read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement shift and caps lock.</strong></p>
<p>Modify your driver so it correctly handles caps lock and shift.
If you press a key while the shift key is down, <code>keyboard_read</code>
should return the result of the character is <code>shift_lookup_table</code>.
If you press the caps lock key, then shift should be enabled
until caps lock is pressed again. If you press shift while
caps lock is enabled, characters should be lower case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lines of text.</strong></p>
<p>At this point, you should be able to handle most characters typed
at the keyboard. Implement a simple console that lets you type
in commands. This means storing lines of text which typing feeds
into. When someone types delete or backspace (scan code <code>0x66</code>), the
console should delete the last character on the current line, or
do nothing if the line is empty. When someone types return/enter
(scan code <code>0x5A</code>), the console should call <code>console_execute()</code>
with the contents of that line and go to the next line.</p>
<p>You do not have to handle line wrap: if a line reaches the end of
the screen you should stop accepting new key strokes.</p>
<p>You do not have to handle scrolling: if the console reaches the bottom
of the screen it should stay at the bottom line and delete the previous
one when return is pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fractals!</strong></p>
<p>Fill in <code>console_execute()</code> so that if someone types the command
<code>attractor</code> it invokes <code>strange_attractor</code> from <code>fractal.h</code>
with a parameter you decide. This call should never return --
you will need to reboot the Pi to get back to the console.
Also add a command <code>list</code> that
lists all of the available commands in the line(s) below the current
one then brings the user to a new line. Finally, add a command <code>clear</code>
that clears the screen and brings the console back to the top line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Handing in</h3>
<p>Commit your code to your repository.</p>
<h3>Extensions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better command line</strong>. Extend your command line so it explicitly
    displays where the cursor is (e.g., by inverting colors or a white line
    at the bottom) and allows the user to move back and forth with
    the arrow keys. So, for example, someone can type "attrctor", then
    hit left arrow 4 times and type "a" to spell "attractor". Hitting
    return at any point in the line should execute the entire command.
    Also, support history: allow the user to type the up arrow to recall
    prior commands and easily re-execute them. Finally, support scrolling,
    such that if the console reaches the bottom of the screen then previous
    lines move up to make room.</li>
