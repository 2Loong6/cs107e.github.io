## Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers

Everyone is familiar with decimal numbers. However, with computers it is often much more convenient to work with binary and hexadecimal numbers.
We also need to learn how to deal with bits, and bitwise operators.

Do you know the answers to the following questions?

1 What is the decimal value of 0b1000?

2 What is 255 in hexdecimal?

3 What is 0xA in binary?

4 What are the mimimum numbers of bits needed to store the number 8?

5 What does 0b01 + 0b20 equal?

6 What is 0x01 AND 0x02? 0x01 OR 0x2? 0x01 EOR 0x02?

7 What is the value of 0x01 shifted left by 2?
